# `SOLID principles in Java`
This is a repository to demonstrate the SOLID principles in Java. The SOLID principles are a set of five principles that help to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code. The SOLID principles are:

- **`Single Responsibility Principle:`** [A class should have only one reason to change.](https://github.com/JahidulHasanSuhel/Concepts-of-SOLID/blob/master/SingleResponsibility.md)
- **`Open/Closed Principle:`** [A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.](https://github.com/JahidulHasanSuhel/Concepts-of-SOLID/blob/master/OpenClosed.md)
- **`Liskov Substitution Principle:`** [Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.](https://github.com/JahidulHasanSuhel/Concepts-of-SOLID/blob/master/LiskovSubstitution.md)
- **`Interface Segregation Principle:`** [A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use.](https://github.com/JahidulHasanSuhel/Concepts-of-SOLID/blob/master/InterfaceSegregation.md)
- **`Dependency Inversion Principle:`** [High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.](https://github.com/JahidulHasanSuhel/Concepts-of-SOLID/blob/master/DependencyInversion.md)
